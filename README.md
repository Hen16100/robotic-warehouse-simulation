# Robotic Warehouse Simulation

## Overview
This project simulates an agent-based robotic warehouse system using discrete-event simulation. It models robots, shelves, and customer orders to analyze task allocation, routing, and system performance.

## Repository Structure
- `main.py` - main simulation entry point
- `src/` - Python classes for Warehouse, Robot, Order, Shelf, Task
- `diagrams/` - UML diagrams (PlantUML)
- `docs/` - proposal PDF and future reports
- `data/` - logs and metrics

## Status
- Initial repository setup with project structure and placeholder files.
